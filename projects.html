                    <h3>PawPals</h3>
                    <p>Contributed to a team project aimed at developing a user-friendly mobile application for
                        buying and selling dogs, drawing inspiration from popular dating apps. Collaborated closely
                        with three peers throughout the entire development process, utilizing Java for both frontend
                        and backend development. Employed Android Studio for frontend development and IntelliJ for
                        database support, ensuring seamless integration and functionality. Actively engaged in the
                        conception, construction, and issue-resolution phases, demonstrating effective teamwork and
                        problem-solving skills. Leveraging our combined efforts, we successfully created an
                        intuitive platform that revolutionizes the dog-buying and selling experience.</p>

                    <h3>Movie Selector</h3>
                    <p>Engaged in an ongoing personal project focused on developing a Python script to efficiently
                        web scrape movie information from popular movie websites. The script meticulously collects
                        essential details including movie title, description, rating, and length, streamlining the
                        process of gathering comprehensive movie data. As a continuous endeavor to enhance Python
                        proficiency, this project also serves the purpose of creating a foundation for organizing
                        the collected movies. The ultimate goal is to design a user-friendly interface that allows
                        me to randomly select a movie based on specific filters applied to the data. By combining
                        data manipulation techniques and web scraping methodologies, this project not only enriches
                        Python skills but also provides a practical solution for deciding what movie to watch.</p>

                    <h3>Rotating Banner</h3>
                    <p>In a collaborative effort, we developed a dynamic moving banner using Quartus Prime and an
                        FPGA board. Utilizing a string of 7-segment displays, we created a captivating rotating
                        effect by moving a 5-letter word across the displays. Registers stored word values, while
                        flip-flops facilitated precise movement control. This project highlights our proficiency in
                        FPGA programming and digital design, showcasing our ability to create visually engaging
                        displays with innovative technology.</p>

                    <h3>Single Cycle Processor</h3>
                    <p>The Collaborative Development of a Single Cycle Processor project aimed to create a
                        high-performance processor using VHDL for coding and Questasim for testing. The processor
                        featured memory, registers, an ALU, and a PC counter, enabling execution of diverse
                        instructions like addition, subtraction, loading, and storing. Designed for single-cycle
                        execution, it maximized efficiency with each instruction completing within a single clock
                        cycle. Extensive testing and verification using Questasim ensured correctness and
                        reliability. The resulting processor exhibited exceptional functionality, reliability, and
                        scalability, underscoring collaborative innovation in digital design and verification
                        methodologies.</p>
